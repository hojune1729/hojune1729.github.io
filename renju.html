<h2>What is Renju?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renju" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Renju</a>
is a strategic board game that can be viewed as a special case of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">m,n,k-game</a>,
where two players try to place k stones in a row on an m×n grid.
Standard Gomoku, a (15,15,5)-game, is mathematically known to be a first-player win under perfect play.
This imbalance comes from the strategy-stealing argument in combinatorial game theory, which shows that the second player cannot have a forced win.
Renju was created to restore fairness by introducing mathematical constraints on the first player’s moves.
In particular, the first player is forbidden from certain powerful patterns such as double-threes, double-fours, and overlines.
Thus, Renju can be seen as a modified m,n,k-game designed to balance theoretical advantages through rule-based restrictions.
